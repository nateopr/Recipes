        <p>Ah yes - Pasta! I could go on and on about how much I love eating pasta. When I was but a mere lad, I would look up at my dear mother, and ask her, "Mother! From whence cometh the pasta noodle, and until what time must I wait to partake in it again?"
            And now, I present to you, the best pasta recipe. One that was passed down from Mario himself after he and his brother took down the great green dinosaur. Enjoy!
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pasta noodles grown from an al-dente tree</li>
                <li>Purified tears of the mushroom kingdom</li>
                <li>Tomatoes plucked from the heart of an ancient being</li>
                <li>Literally any green leaves you can find outside</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To start, place the tears in a pan, and boil at medium heat</li>
                <li>After tears have begun to boil, add the pasta noodles</li>
                <li>While pasta is boiling, smash tomatoes into a paste</li>
                <li>After exactly 5:47 seconds, strain the noodles. Do not let them get soft, otherwise they will come to life and fight back</li>
                <li>Add tomatoe paste</li>
                <li>Add leaves</li>
