        <p>It is a tale as old as time. Bread meets meat. More bread meets more meat. Mouth eats bread and meat. Mundane as it may be, more meat has met its maker by this method than by any other means. And it should stay that way. Sandwiches are a simple yet delicate artform, honed over humanities time on earth to become the perfect afternoon snack.
            BEHOLD: THE SANDWICH </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fresh, wild bread hunted from the plains of CANADA</li>
                <li>Costco sliced bologna</li>
                <li>Hummus</li>
                <li>Fresh tomato specifically plucked from my grandmother's garden</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First, place your freshly hunted bread on a plate. Just one slice will do</li>
                <li>Place 5 slices of bologna on the bread, each folded in half, overlapping the next</li>
                <li>Spread hummus on the 2nd bread slice </li>
                <li>Slice your tomato, and place the piece on top of the bologna. The thicker the slice, the better</li>
                <li>Lay the hummused bread atop the bottom slice</li>
                <li>Eat immediately, before scavengers approach and steal your sandwich</li>
            </ol>
